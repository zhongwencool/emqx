# EMQX InfluxDB Bridge

[InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) is an open-source time-series
database that is optimized for storing, retrieving, and querying large volumes of
time-stamped data.
It is commonly used for monitoring and analysis of metrics, events, and real-time
analytics.
InfluxDB is designed to be fast, efficient, and scalable, and it has a SQL-like
query language that makes it easy to extract insights from time-series data.

The application is used to connect EMQX and InfluxDB. User can create a rule and
easily ingest IoT data into InfluxDB by leveraging
[EMQX Rules](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v5.0/data-integration/rules.html).
