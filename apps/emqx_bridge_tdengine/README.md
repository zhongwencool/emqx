# EMQX TDEngine Bridge

[TDEngine](https://github.com/taosdata/TDengine) is an open-source, cloud-native
time series database (TSDB) optimized for Internet of Things (IoT), Connected Cars,
and Industrial IoT.
It enables efficient, real-time ingestion, processing, and monitoring of petabytes
of data per day, generated by billions of sensors and data collectors.
