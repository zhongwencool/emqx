# Apache IoTDB Data Integration Bridge

This application houses the IoTDB data integration bridge for EMQX Enterprise
 Edition. It provides the means to connect to IoTDB and publish messages to it.

It implements the connection management and interaction without need for a
 separate connector app, since it's not used by authentication and authorization
 applications.
