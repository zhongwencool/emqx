# EMQX TimescaleDB Bridge

[TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescaleDB/timescaleDB) is an open-source database
designed to make SQL scalable for time-series data.
It is engineered up from PostgreSQL and packaged as a PostgreSQL extension,
providing automatic partitioning across time and space (partitioning key), as well as full SQL support.

The application is used to connect EMQX and TimescaleDB.
User can create a rule and easily ingest IoT data into TimescaleDB by leveraging
[EMQX Rules](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v5.0/data-integration/rules.html).
