# EMQX DynamoDB Bridge

[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a high-performance NoSQL database
service provided by Amazon that's designed for scalability and low-latency access
to structured data.

It's often used in applications that require fast and reliable access to data,
such as mobile, ad tech, and IoT.
