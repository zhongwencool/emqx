# EMQX RabbitMQ Bridge

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is a powerful, open-source message broker
that facilitates asynchronous communication between different components of an
application. Built on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), RabbitMQ
enables the reliable transmission of messages by decoupling the sender and
receiver components. This separation allows for increased scalability,
robustness, and flexibility in application architecture.

RabbitMQ is commonly used for a wide range of purposes, such as distributing
tasks among multiple workers, enabling event-driven architectures, and
implementing publish-subscribe patterns. It is a popular choice for
microservices, distributed systems, and real-time applications, providing an
efficient way to handle varying workloads and ensuring message delivery in
complex environments.

This application is used to connect EMQX and RabbitMQ. User can create a rule
and easily ingest IoT data into RabbitMQ by leveraging
[EMQX Rules](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v5.0/data-integration/rules.html).
