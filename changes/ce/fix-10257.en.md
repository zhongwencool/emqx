Fixed the issue where `auto_observe` was not working in LwM2M Gateway.

Before the fix, OBSERVE requests were sent without a token, causing failures
that LwM2M clients could not handle.

After the fix, LwM2M Gateway can correctly observe the resource list carried by
client, furthermore, unknown resources will be ignored and printing the following
warning log:
```
