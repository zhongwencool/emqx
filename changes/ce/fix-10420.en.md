Fix HTTP path handling when composing the URL for the HTTP requests in authentication and authorization modules.
* Avoid unnecessary URL normalization since we cannot assume that external servers treat original and normalized URLs equally. This led to bugs like [#10411](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/10411).
* Fix the issue that path segments could be HTTP encoded twice.
