An issue with the MongoDB connector related to the "Max Overflow" parameter has been fixed. Previously, the minimum limit for the parameter was incorrectly set to 1 instead of allowing a minimum value of 0. This issue has been fixed, and the "Max Overflow" parameter now correctly supports a minimum value of 0.
