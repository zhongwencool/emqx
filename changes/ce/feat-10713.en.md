We hide the request_timeout in resource_option of the webhook to keep it consistent with the http request_timeout of the webhook.
From now on, when configuring a webhook through API or configuration files,
it is no longer necessary to configure the request_timeout of the resource. Only configuring the http request_timeout is sufficient, and the request_timeout in the resource will automatically be consistent with the http request_timeout.
