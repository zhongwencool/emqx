Fix error in `/api/v5/monitor_current` API endpoint that happens when some EMQX nodes are down.

Prior to this fix, sometimes the request returned HTTP code 500 and the following message:
```
{"code":"INTERNAL_ERROR","message":"error, badarg, [{erlang,'++',[{error,nodedown},[{node,'emqx@10.42.0.150'}]], ...
```
