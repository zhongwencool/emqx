Improve 'emqx_alarm' performance by using Mnesia dirty operations and avoiding
unnecessary calls from 'emqx_resource_manager' to reactivate alarms that have been already activated.
Use new safe 'emqx_alarm' API to activate/deactivate alarms to ensure that emqx_resource_manager
doesn't crash because of alarm timeouts.
The crashes were possible when the following conditions co-occurred:
 - a relatively high number of failing resources, e.g. bridges tried to activate alarms on re-occurring errors;
 - the system experienced a very high load.
