Don't increment 'actions.failed.unknown' rule metrics counter upon receiving unrecoverable bridge errors.
This counter is displayed on the dashboard's rule overview tab ('Action statistics' - 'Unknown'). 
The fix is only applicable for synchronous bridges, as all rule actions for asynchronous bridges 
are counted as successful (they increment 'actions.success' which is displayed as 'Action statistics' - 'Success').
