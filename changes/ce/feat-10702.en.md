Introduce a more straightforward configuration option `keepalive_multiplier` and
deprecate the old `keepalive_backoff` configuration.
After this enhancement, EMQX checks the client's keepalive timeout status
period by multiplying the "Client Requested Keepalive Interval" with `keepalive_multiplier`.
