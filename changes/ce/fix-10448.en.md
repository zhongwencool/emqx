Fix a compatibility issue of limiter configuration introduced by v5.0.23 which broke the upgrade from previous versions if the `capacity` is `infinity`. 

In v5.0.23 we have replaced `capacity` with `burst`. After this fix, a `capacity = infinity` config will be automatically converted to equivalent `burst = 0`.
