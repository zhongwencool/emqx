Enhance the error logs related to InfluxDB connectivity health checks.
Previously, if InfluxDB failed to pass the health checks using the specified parameters, the only message provided was "timed out waiting for it to become healthy".
With the updated implementation, the error message will be displayed in both the logs and the dashboard, enabling easier identification and resolution of the issue.
