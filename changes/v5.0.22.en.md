# v5.0.22

## Enhancements

- [#10077](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10077) Add support for QUIC TLS password protected certificate file.


- [#10128](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10128) Add support for OCSP stapling for SSL MQTT listeners.

- [#10164](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10164) Add CRL check support for TLS MQTT listeners.

- [#10206](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10206) Decouple the query mode from the underlying call mode for buffer
  workers.

  Prior to this change, setting the query mode of a resource
  such as a bridge to `sync` would force the buffer to call the
  underlying connector in a synchronous way, even if it supports async
  calls.

- [#10207](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10207) Use 'label' from i18n file as 'summary' in OpenAPI spec.

- [#10210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10210) Unregister Mnesia post commit hook when Mria is being stopped.
  This fixes hook failures occasionally occurring on stopping/restarting Mria.

  [Mria PR](https://github.com/emqx/mria/pull/133)

- [#10224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10224) Add the option to customize `clusterIP` in Helm chart, so that a user may set it to a fixed IP.

- [#10263](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10263) Add command 'eval-ex' for Elixir expression evaluation.

- [#10278](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10278) Refactor the directory structure of all gateways.

- [#10306](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10306) Add support for `async` query mode for most bridges.

  Before this change, some bridges (Cassandra, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, RocketMQ, TDengine) were only allowed to be created with a `sync` query mode.

- [#10318](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10318) Now, the rule engine language's FROM clause supports both strings enclosed in double quotes (") and single quotes (').

- [#10336](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10336) Add `/rule_engine` API endpoint to manage configuration of rule engine.



## Bug Fixes

- [#10145](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10145) Fix `bridges` API to report error conditions for a failing bridge as
  `status_reason`. Also when creating an alarm for a failing resource we include
  this error condition with the alarm's message.

- [#10154](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10154) Change the default `resume_interval` for bridges and connectors to be
  the minimum of `health_check_interval` and `request_timeout / 3`.
  Also exposes it as a hidden configuration to allow fine tuning.

  Before this change, the default values for `resume_interval` meant
  that, if a buffer ever got blocked due to resource errors or high
  message volumes, then, by the time the buffer would try to resume its
  normal operations, almost all requests would have timed out.

- [#10172](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10172) Fix the incorrect default ACL rule, which was:
  ```
  {allow, {username, "^dashboard?"}, subscribe, ["$SYS/#"]}.
  ```

  However, it should use `{re, "^dashboard$"}` to perform a regular expression match:
  ```
  {allow, {username, {re,"^dashboard$"}}, subscribe, ["$SYS/#"]}.
  ```

- [#10174](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10174) Upgrade library `esockd` from 5.9.4 to 5.9.6.
  Fix an unnecessary error level logging when a connection is closed before proxy protocol header is sent by the proxy.

- [#10195](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10195) Add labels to API schemas where description contains HTML and breaks formatting of generated documentation otherwise.

- [#10196](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10196) Use lower-case for schema summaries and descritptions to be used in menu of generated online documentation.

- [#10209](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10209) Fix bug where a last will testament (LWT) message could be published
  when kicking out a banned client.

- [#10211](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10211) Hide `broker.broker_perf` config and API documents.
  The two configs `route_lock_type` and `trie_compaction` are rarely used and requires a full cluster restart to take effect. They are not suitable for being exposed to users.
  Detailed changes can be found here: https://gist.github.com/zmstone/01ad5754b9beaeaf3f5b86d14d49a0b7/revisions

- [#10225](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10225) Allow installing a plugin if its name matches the beginning of another (already installed) plugin name.
  For example: if plugin "emqx_plugin_template_a" is installed, it must not block installing plugin "emqx_plugin_template".

- [#10226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10226) Don't crash on validation error in `/bridges` API, return `400` instead.

- [#10237](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10237) Ensure we return `404` status code for unknown node names in `/nodes/:node[/metrics|/stats]` API.

- [#10242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10242) Fixed a log data field name clash.
  Piror to this fix, some debug logs may report a wrong Erlang PID which may affect troubleshooting session takeover issues.

- [#10251](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10251) Consider bridges referenced in `FROM` rule clauses as dependencies.

  Before this fix, when one tried to delete an ingress rule referenced in an action like `select * from "$bridges/mqtt:ingress"`, the UI would not trigger a warning about dependent rule actions.

- [#10257](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10257) Fixed the issue where `auto_observe` was not working in LwM2M Gateway.

  Before the fix, OBSERVE requests were sent without a token, causing failures
  that LwM2M clients could not handle.

  After the fix, LwM2M Gateway can correctly observe the resource list carried by
  client, furthermore, unknown resources will be ignored and printing the following
  warning log:
  ```
  2023-03-28T18:50:27.771123+08:00 [warning] msg: ignore_observer_resource, mfa: emqx_lwm2m_session:observe_object_list/3, line: 522, peername: 127.0.0.1:56830, clientid: testlwm2mclient, object_id: 31024, reason: no_xml_definition
  ```

- [#10286](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10286) Enhance logging behaviour during boot failure.
  When EMQX fails to start due to corrupted configuration files, excessive logging is eliminated and no crash dump file is generated.

- [#10297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10297) Keeps `eval` command backward compatible with v4 by evaluating only Erlang expressions, even on Elixir node. For Elixir expressions, use `eval-ex` command.

- [#10300](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10300) Fixed an issue where a build made with Elixir could not receive uploaded plugins until the `plugins` folder was created manually to receive the uploaded files.

- [#10313](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10313) Ensure that when the core or replicant node starting, the `cluster-override.conf` file is only copied from the core node.
  Previously, when sorting nodes by startup time, the core node may have copied this file from the replicant node.

- [#10314](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10314) Fix /monitor_current API so that it only looks at the current node.
  Fix /stats API to not crash when one or more nodes in the cluster are down.

- [#10315](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10315) Fix crash checking `limit` and `page` parameters in `/mqtt/delayed/messages` API call.

- [#10317](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10317) Do not expose listener level authentications before extensive verification.

- [#10323](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10323) For security reasons, the value of the `password` field in the API examples is replaced with `******`.


- [#10327](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10327) Don't increment 'actions.failed.unknown' rule metrics counter upon receiving unrecoverable bridge errors.
  This counter is displayed on the dashboard's rule overview tab ('Action statistics' - 'Unknown').
  The fix is only applicable for synchronous bridges, as all rule actions for asynchronous bridges
  are counted as successful (they increment 'actions.success' which is displayed as 'Action statistics' - 'Success').
